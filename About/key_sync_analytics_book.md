# KeySync Analytics Book 📊

This is the **official analytics reference for KeySync** — covering both the founder (platform owner) view and project owner view, all through CLI commands. Designed to be **fun, CLI-friendly, and privacy-first**.

---

## 1. Analytics Philosophy

KeySync analytics is built on **one principle:** track usage **without ever seeing secrets**. All analytics are metadata-only.

Goals:
- Give **platform adoption insights** for the founder
- Give **project usage insights** for project owners
- Maintain **zero knowledge** of secrets
- Be **CLI-friendly**, fast, and fun

No dashboards required (CLI-first). Zero secrets visible.

---

## 2. Roles and Scope

| Role | Scope | Access |
|------|-------|--------|
| KeySync Founder | Platform-wide | All accounts, projects, blobs (metadata only) |
| Project Owner | Own projects | Each project they own; optional account-wide summary |

---

## 3. Event Types

All analytics are derived from **metadata events** generated by API and CLI:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-01T12:34:56Z",
  "event": "secret_push",
  "account_id": "acc_123",
  "project_id": "proj_456",
  "user_key_fingerprint": "SHA256:abcd...",
  "env": "prod",
  "status": "success"
}
```

Event categories:
- `account_created`
- `project_created`
- `key_added`
- `key_removed`
- `secret_push`
- `secret_pull`
- `error`

No secret values are ever logged.
