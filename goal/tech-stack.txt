# KeySync Tech Stack 🛠️

## 1. Core Stack
| Component | Technology | Justification |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **CLI** | **Go (Golang)** | Cross-platform binaries (Win/Mac/Linux), strong SSH support, no runtime deps. |
| **Encryption** | **age / Go crypto** | Modern, secure, simple. Supports recipient-based encryption (SSH keys). |
| **Local Storage** | **SQLite / JSON** | Lightweight, file-based, offline-ready. |
| **Server** | **Go + Railway** | Hosted on Railway. Zero-knowledge architecture. |

## 2. Infrastructure
*   **Backend Hosting:** **Railway** (Go Service).
*   **Database:** **Postgres on Railway** (for accounts, project metadata, and analytics).
*   **Blob Storage:** Encrypted blobs stored via Backend (backed by Railway Volume or S3-compatible store).
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / Vercel for automated secret injection.

## 3. Security Decisions 🔐
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** Secrets are encrypted on the client *before* transmission.
*   **Zero-Knowledge:** Server receives and stores only ciphertext.
*   **Identity:** Relying on SSH keys involves no shared secrets or passwords.
*   **Revocation:** Immediate key removal prevents future decryption (rotation required for past secrets).

## 4. Why Go?
*   **Performance:** Fast encryption/decryption of large env files.
*   **Concurrency:** Efficient handling of multiple keys/recipients.
*   **Distribution:** Single binary is easier for devs to install than Python/Node scripts.
